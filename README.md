# Comparing QQQ and VOO Using Monte Carlo Simulations

## Purpose
The purpose of this project is to compare possible outcomes of QQQ and VOO and determine whether investing in QQQ is worth the additional risk over investing in VOO.

## Contents
*  **`src/main.py`**: The complete analysis 
*  **`src/utils.py`**: Utility functions that would clutter the notebook

## To Run:
* This project utilizes `uv` for managing dependencies and running the notebook.
* If you have uv installed, you can run `uv run main.py` in your terminal and uv will automatically download all dependencies and run the file
* Uploading the code in notebook format was not possible due to GitHub contraints on file sizes.
	* Each `#%%` represents a new cell
